Kata Layout
===========

Pip is a good developer but he is slow on the keyboard: he doesn't touch type.
But since he is worried about improving his skills wants to learn. He has been asking
a few colegues about what layout to learn, but each one recommends him a different one:

- Abe told that the most used one is **qwerty** and that is the one best worth learning.

- Sebas has been using **dvorak** for years and highly recommends it.

- Aimee says that **colemak** is the best layout out there and that it's easier to learn than dvorak.

Pip has decided to choose the one layout that allows him to write more words with the home and upper row.
